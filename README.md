# Hi, I'm Mohit 👋

1. I'm a Software Engineer focused on building and managing applications. My work is centred on creating functional and efficient software solutions that deliver a great user experience. 

2. I have experience building user interfaces with React, Angular, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. On the backend, I have implemented services with Node.js, Express, and GraphQL. 

3. Beyond development, I bring an understanding of cloud infrastructure, having worked hands-on with AWS services (including IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, and Lambda) and Docker.

4. I'm always learning and recently have been exploring how AI tools can support development work. 

5. I'm open to connecting with other professionals to collaborate, exchange ideas, or discuss software design and development. 🚀
