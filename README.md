# Hi, I'm Mohit 👋

1. I'm a Software Engineer with a focus on building & improving scalable applications and seamless user experiences.

2. I’ve worked across the stack, from frontend (React, Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) to backend (Node.js, Express, GraphQL).
  
3. Beyond development, I bring an understanding of cloud infrastructure, having worked hands-on experience with AWS services (including IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, CloudWatch, Lambda, etc) and Docker.

5. Always happy to chat about interesting tech ideas, share learnings, or build something new. 🚀
